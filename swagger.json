        "description": "*(based on Berlin Group 1.3-20181220)*\n# Spuerkeess related specificities associated with this version of the OpenAPI specification\n## General remarks\n* For the moment being, Spuerkeess only supports the redirect approach. The authentication flows are equal to those implemented on the customer interface of Spuerkeess. A PSU that has authenticated for payment initiation, will be redirected to the URL made available by the TPP.\n* In a mobile context, Spuerkeess will redirect the PSU to its mobile app (deeplink) for authentication prior to the redirection to the URL made available by the TPP.\n## Consent and Consent Management\n\n  * Spuerkeess exclusively supports a Detailed consent approach (please refer to the Luxhub API description). PSUs, that have given consent at the TPP interface, will have to authenticate at the Spuerkeess interface. Two implementation scenarios are possible: \n      * The PSU grants the TPP access to the list of available accounts. The PSU is redirected to the Spuerkeess interface for authentication. After redirection to the TPP, the PSU selects the account(s) and gives final consent to the TPP.\n      *  The PSU manually enters his account(s) directly at the TPP interface and gives consent. The PSU is redirected to Spuerkeess for authentication and then redirected back to the TPP.\n  * Consent can be revoked at both the TPP or ASPSP side. No SCA is required for this purpose.\n  * The maximum supported consent validity period is 90 days.\n   \n## Initiation of payments\n\n  * All types indicated in the specifications are supported. SCTinst payments are not yet supported by Spuerkeess.\n  \n  * Spuerkeess supports both specific (debtor account specified on the TPP side), as well as non-specific (debtor account not specified on the TPP side) payment initiation requests. In the latter case, the PSU may choose the account on the Spuerkeess interface in sequence to the authorisation step. \n  \n  * In case of insufficient funds or other errors related to the PSU\u2019s account, the payment will be rejected followed by the redirection of the PSU to the TPP interface. In case of a non-specific request, the PSU may however select a different debtor account on the Spuerkeess interface in order to finalise the payment.\n\n## Standing orders\n\n  * The initiation of a standing order by a TPP results in the normal creation of such a payment on the Spuerkeess interface with one single reference.\n  \n  * For standing orders, only SCT payments are supported.\n  \n  * TPPs might delete a standing order, but technically cannot modify it on their side. TPPs need to cancel and to recreate standing orders in such a case. PSUs may however reconfigurate the order on the Spuerkeess interface (amount, start/end date and periodicity, etc.).\n  \n  * It is only possible to delete the standing order as a whole. In this case, planned, but not yet executed, payments will also be deleted.\n  \n  * It is not possible to deactivate a standing order, except by deleting it.\n  \n  * TPPs can only be notified about the proper initiation of a standing order. TPPs however need to reconcile the individual scheduled payments.\n  \n  * Standing orders are only supported for \u201cPRIV\u201d accounts.\n  \n  * Spuerkeess supports multiple periodicity types (please refer to the specification for more details).\n  \n  * The start date cannot be set on a Luxembourg bank holiday, nor to the 31st of a month (for internal technical reasons). The allowed date range is [D+1;360].\n  \n  * The end date is not mandatory. A standing order is considered as perpetual then.\n  \n## Future payments\n\n  * Future payments are supported. The allowed date range is [D+1; D+360].\n  \n  * Initiated Future payments cannot be modified, but only deleted.\n  \n  \n  * No SCA is needed to delete a future payment.\n  \n  * Future payments may be deleted by TPPs, but only prior to their execution date (D-1 at latest).\n  \n## Bulk payment\n\n  * Spuerkeess supports Bulk-payments for \u201cORGA\u201d accounts only.\n  \n  * Only the file format specified in the following specification are supported.\n  \n  * Bulk payments might only be deleted prior to their definite execution (file with future execution date).\n  \n  * It is only possible to delete bulk payments as a whole (i.e. all payments at once).\n  \n  * A bulk payment can only be executed or rejected as a whole. If a single payment is rejected (e.g. wrong format), the whole bulk file is rejected.\n  \n  * A TPP cannot modify or delete single payments included in a Bulk file once the payments have been initiated.\n  \n## Signature of payments related to \u201cORGA\u201d accounts\n\n  * The signing basket method is not supported by Spuerkeess.\n  \n  * TPPs must include the appropriate Luxtrust generated  signature(s) in the header of the pain.001 file, in order to allow Spuerkeess to verify the payment authorisation rights (please refer to Luxtrust \u2013 www.Luxtrust.lu for further instructions related to generation of signatures). \n  \n  * The PSU validating the payment(s) on the TPP side will be redirected to the Spuerkeess dedicated interface for identification. Spuerkeess will at this point only verify the rights of this PSU to send the payment instruction (this allows TPPs to handle different authorisation levels on its interface, where some PSUs may sign payments, while others may only be authorised to send the instruction on their behalf). When receiving the payment instruction, Spuerkeess will verify the signatures as stated below. If the signatures allow for the execution of the payment on the specified account, the payment will be initiated. In the opposite case, the payment is rejected. \n  \n    The file (pain.001) must be in the pain.001.001.03 format. It will be encapsulated in a container including the signature(s) of the client(s) that sign the payment. The structure has to be as follows:<br /><br /> \\<MultilinePayment\\><br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\\<Signatures\\><br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\<Signature\\>XXXXXXXXXXX\\</Signature\\><br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\<Signature\\>YYYYYYYYYYY\\</Signature\\><br />\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\\</Signatures\\><br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; *\\<Document : xmlns=\"urn:iso:std:iso:20022:tech:xsd:pain.001.001.03\"\\>*<br />\n    \\</MultilinePayment\\><br />\n  \n## Transaction history\n\n  * Spuerkeess uses concatenated transaction details in its banking interface (ex. Direct debit in favour of XXXX / Wire transfer from YYYY) in the respective language of the PSU as agreed with Spuerkeess. Those details will be included as a whole, or in the debitor, or in the creditor name field. No separate debtor or creditor values are available for those fields, pursuant to Spuerkeesss PSU banking interface.\n  \n  * However, detailed statements in common XML formats are made available for \u201cORGA\u201d accounts.\n  \n  * Pending payments include future payments (date >D+1) as well as executed but not yet booked payments.\n\n# Summary\nThe **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of \nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely. \nThe NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards \nin Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board,\nenables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service') \nby granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.\n\nThe possible Approaches are:\n  * Redirect SCA Approach\n  * OAuth SCA Approach\n  * Decoupled SCA Approach (not supported by Spuerkeess)\n  * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method (not supported by Spuerkeess)\n  * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available (not supported by Spuerkeess)\n  * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method (not supported by Spuerkeess)\n\n  Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches. \n  Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional\n  Therefore for a particular implementation of a Berlin Group PSD2 compliant API it is only necessary to support \n  a certain subset of the methods defined in this API definition.\n\n  **Please have a look at the implementation guidelines if you are not sure \n  which message has to be used for the approach you are going to use.**\n\n## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification:\n* **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.** \n  It is not an replacement in any sense.\n  The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.\n* **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.**\n* **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n* According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]\n  \n    \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"\n  \n  The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.\n  \n  The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".\n  \n* There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages, \n  but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.\n  Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.\n  We added them for the convenience of the user.\n  If there is a payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.\n  But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.\n  \n* **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional) \n  except they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**\n  Therefore the implementer might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements define in this file.\n   \n## General Remarks on Data Types\n\nThe Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least the following characters\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n/ - ? : ( ) . , ' +\n\nSpace\n",
